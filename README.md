### Essa é a breve documentação do APP feito por mim chamado: Agent-Info.

## Commands:
 - /info help: Show the commands for this app
 - /info users-list [**your password**]: Shows available agents based on departments, it's a great use for workspaces that have several bots working and different attendants for them.
   
 **OBS**: The password is necessary because the app records in the logs the user who invoked the command and also to call the APIs that need to be authenticated.
